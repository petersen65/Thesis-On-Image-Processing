Scientific theories deal with concepts, not with reality. All theoretical results are derived from certain axioms by
deductive logic. In physical sciences the theories are so formulated as to correspond in some useful sense to the
real world, whatever that may mean. However, this correspondence is approximate, and the physical
justification of all theoretical conclusions is based on some form of inductive reasoning.
